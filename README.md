# WeatherAPP

In this project,  i created angular weather application which tells you the weather of a location.

This Angular project will have a search functionality in which the user can type in the location for which they want to search the weather for.

# Creating UI Structure For Our App

The upper data section will hold the name of the location and the temperature.

The lower data section will be like a more information section holding other related details like minimum temperature, maximum temperature etc.



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
